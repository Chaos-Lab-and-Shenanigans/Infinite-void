# Infinite-void  

## Introduction  
Welcome to Infinite-void disguised as fortune teller, the world’s most annoying oracle. Every time you try to close it, it pops right back up with another prophecy you didn’t ask for. Think Clippy, but meaner and with less job security. Perfect for those moments when you want your computer to feel like it’s actively trolling you.  
The prophecy is 99% accurate, why? Some wise words for you...

"_You can predict the future, if you're the one making it happen..._"

## How to escape

## Requirements

## Closing words  

That’s it. You now own a sarcastic crystal ball that refuses to die.  
Use it responsibly: prank your friends (the consenting ones), roast yourself, or just marvel at how easily humans get outwitted by a window with an attitude problem.  
Remember — **_with great power comes great responsibility…_** and also the ability to spawn a thousand tiny windows of regret.
